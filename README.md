## Purpose/Inspiration
Amidst the rising concern of climate change affecting species, including our own, all over the world, Earth has approximately 11 years to cut emissions to avoid dire climate scenarios before it is completely irreversible. There are many environmental health initiatives around the world that donâ€™t have a specific platform to promote and recruit volunteers. From this, it creates the idea to create a social network specifically for environmental health initiatives to promote the fight against climate change.
